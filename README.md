## Application Architecture

### Database Structure

The application uses a MySQL database with a well-structured schema that includes:

- **Parliamentary Procedures**: Stores information about parliamentary procedures
- **Documents**: Contains document details including names and PDF links
- **Authors**: Manages author information
- **Subscribers**: Handles user subscriptions
- **Relationship Tables**: Manages many-to-many relationships between documents and authors, and subscribers and authors

The database is designed with proper indexing, foreign key constraints, and timestamp tracking for all records.
